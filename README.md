## reactive-services examples
This repository provides some samples of Java RESTful services and a client built in a 'reactive way'.
This is a recommended approach to provide and consume web service in Spring 5.
This reactive approach is coming as a replacement to well-known Spring MVC and RestTemplate.

This repo has a single project built with Maven.
The project has two small SpringBoot applications:
* com.grenader.reactive.server.ReactiveServerApplication - is a reactive web-services application that uses Spring Webflux.
* com.grenader.reactive.client.ReactiveClientApplication - is a Reactive client application that uses org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient

The server application also has a SpringBoot unit tests that showcase how to test Reactive web-service using org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient

## How to build a project
```mvn clean package```

## How to run a project
```mvn spring-boot:run```

The above command will start a server SpringBoot application.
It will answer on port 8080. 
http://localhost:8080/mono URL can be used to call a simple service that returns a string.

## How to run a client application
```java -cp target/reactive-services-0.1.0.jar  -Dloader.main=com.grenader.reactive.client.ReactiveClientApplication org.springframework.boot.loader.PropertiesLauncher```

The above command will start a client StringBoot application. The application will occupy port 8090. It expects the server application (port localhost:8080) to be run.
The client application:
* constructs a business object from three web-service calls made in a sequence;
* constructs a business object from three web-service calls made in parallel via reactive client;
* makes a hundred parallel calls to constructs a business object from three web-service calls made in a sequence;
* makes a hundred parallel calls to constructs a business object from three web-service calls made in parallel via reactive client;
* makes a single plain text call to a server;
* makes a hundred plain text calls to the server in a sequential order and prints how much time that took;
* makes a hundred plain text calls to the server in a parraller order and prints how much time that took.

## Example of the client application output:

## Source code
The source code of the application adhere to Maven standard project structure. Explore it to get details about reactive way to build and call web services.
Reactive Client code is located in **com.grenader.reactive.client.MonoWebClient.java** class.
